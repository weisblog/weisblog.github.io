<span id="more"></span>

<ul>
<li>The only way to make money when you’re poor is to steal it or scam it. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What is it with men and their johnsons…Shaking them on buses, using them to blackmail potential employees? You know, that was probably a good job too…Benifits, discount on groceries.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You are a man now, carl. The cancel makes you a man. And as a man, it’s your job to keep secrets from the wemen who love you.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(2 women fighting) Well, should we shop’em, or…? What, you  want to lose an eye?</li>
</ul>
</br>

<p>(Floria was trying to stop her collegues do the bj for the manager)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Yeah, if we stick together, collectively boycottt giving him what he wants, maybe it can stop. There’s strength in numbers.</p>
<p>Unitied we stand, Divided, we keep sucking dick.Hey, revolutions have begun with less inspiring phrases.<br>I, like all of you, am happy to have a job, okay? But I don’t want this job if the cost is a never-ending payback hummer. I don’t want to live in that world. It’s not right.<br>-Thank God somebody finally said it.<br>-If We band together, We can put an end to this. An end to hearing your name called over the loudspeaker. An ending to him deciding we’re here to please hime whenever the urge arises. An end to feeling like we have to give him whatever he wants. Like we are desperate whores, who are happy for the attention.<br>Our jobs are not his to threaten us with. Out mouths are not his property to use as he pleases.<br>We need to say this stops now.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s not that bad. I mean he showers daily, keep himself clean. Last year, when my kid got sick, he gave me time off. Says something.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pachy’s right, when I punch in late, he never dock me. </p>
</li>
<li><p>What’s a quick blow job if when my kid is sick I get to stay home?</p>
</li>
<li><p>It’s sexual harassment. </p>
</li>
<li><p>He let me take flowers to put on my mother’s grave, no charge.</p>
</li>
<li><p>He charges you a weekly hummer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It’s once a week for ten minutes. Stick your finger up his rear, and pop his cock, you get it done in two.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If we cause a ruckus, we get him fired. Guess what? We don’t know who’s the next manager will be. What if he doesn’t let us call in sick when we’re  really not sick? What’ if he doesn’t let us go to a funeral without punching out? What if he doesn’t let us take home expired meat and sheet cakes and a pony keg once and again for free? Bobby’s a nice guy. Okay, okay, so we have to provide him with oral pleasure  once a week. Is that such a bad thing?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Think about it, the dick we’re sucking may very well  be better than the dick  we might have to suck instead.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Let’s vote. Secret ballot, let the democratic process unfold.</p>
</li>
<li><p>How would I know? I’ve never done it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You are the reason that I have to pay him an extra hummer this week?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</br>

<ul>
<li><p>The squeaky wheel gets the grease.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Great things don’t happen in tiny little increments. It happens when someone thinks completely differently.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>We are the dinosaurs, my friend. And a big, fat comet is headed for our sweet slice of earth. And that comet is a starbucks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</br>

<p>I saw it during my residency countless times. Patients enduring round after round of poison pumped into their systems, so they can spend what days the have left by the toilet, puking and bald.</p>
<p>I can’t offer you much, but I can do is – is be your chauffeur on the limousine ride to the pearly gates. I know how it feels to live like you are gonna die tomorrow. I’ve been there, I make each day feel like a wild ride through the heart of the rapids at midnight. If you want to squuze every last drop of gratification out of this world before you croak. I am your man. Stick with me womon. And you will not go gentle into that good night.</p>
</br>

<p>(Professor to Lip)<br>You You have a choice right now. To recongnize that you are a promising young colledge student, not some ghetto outlaw. You stop behaving like the world is out to get you when it is so clearly dropping gifts at your feet. Or you keep doing what you doing and you end up in a cell somewhere angry and out of options.</p>
<p><strong>A thirsty man coming out the desert is bound to take a drink. A man only has one kind of camel to ride for many year. That camel ran off, he gonna try to take a few other rides out for a spin before he decides which one he’s gonna drive off the lot.</strong></p>
</br>

<p>(Frank is talking to the teacher of boy)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hey, I read it. A couple of grammatical things here and there. He didn’t remember to capitalize Auschwitz, but the kid can write.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hitler’s diatribe on Aryan superiority is not an appropriate theme for a sixth grade book report.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Did you tell the class they shouldn’t write about Nazis? </p>
</li>
<li><p>Well, usually they are not writing from the Nazi perspective, so no. Look, it’s okay to write about mass murders. You just can’t side with the mass murderers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Uh, this is a direct attack on his First Amendment rights, a right, I might add, that belongs to everyone. Regardless of intelligence deficiencies or possible retardation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Yes, but there are conditions to those rights, like yelling “fire” in a public theater or preaching white supremacy to middle school students. We simply can’t allow Hitler’s hat speech to alienate our diverse student body. We’ve worked very hard to create an open atmosphere for all our students.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Look, you can’t go teaching equality and then get your human rights panties in a bunch when it comes with a couple of wedgies. Every asshole is entitled to his beliefs. That’s the yin and the yang of democracy. It’s the same freedom that alllows you to teach wearing that silly beanie and those Crayola-colored kids out there to go to shool together.<br>It’s doesn’t matter anyway. Pretty soom, there’s not gonna be any Jew or Aryan or Hindu  or Muslim or Mexican or Blacks. There’s just gonna be the rich and the fucked, and our grandson is already one of the fucked. So at least let the boy express the degenerate ideas he can actually comprehend, and that, my multicultural friends, is-liberty-and justice for all.<br>Or we could call the attorney general and the ACLU. l’m sorry, I probably should have started with that.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</br>

<p>(Debbie is looking for a job)</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a  job, I am kept woman. You want a good life? Find someone to keep you.</li>
<li>I don’t need to be kept. I am a strong woman.</li>
<li>Don’t be stong woman. Stong women weather storms. You want to be the strom. </li>
<li>How?</li>
<li>You find someone weak, stupid, and desperate. You wear bras so your breasts levitate.</li>
<li>A pound of high quality methamphetamine, which this clearly is, worth ten grand on the street. If you want to destroy the inheritance   that your mother poured a lifetime of blood, sweat, and tears into, go ahead. You got your pound. </li>
<li>She probably stole it, Frank.</li>
<li>What you do with your pound is your choice, but this is not a dictatorship, Fiona. This is America, and in America, we like democracy. Everybody gets a vote. Give me liberty or qive me meth! We vote. All Gallaghers in favor of flushing $70,000 of your future down the drain, raise your hand.</li>
<li>This is ridiculous.</li>
<li>Come on, raise ‘em up, if you want to lose $10,000 each. Raise ‘em up. Come on, put up y…<br>(Fiona raised her hand)</li>
<li>Lip? Ian?</li>
<li>Ian: I don’t know, maybe we should sleep on it, talk again in the morning?</li>
<li>I am ashamed of all of you. </li>
<li>Oh, come… Nobody likes a sore loser, Fiona. Learning to be gracious in the face of defeat, that shows maturity. So who’s hungry? I’m buying. </li>
</ul>
</br>

<p>(Frank expresses his Condolences to Monica)</p>
<ul>
<li>Monica was the love of my life, and I knew that the first time I ever saw her. I was in college, going nowhere, bored. Summer internships with State Farm Insurance. Junior year I was in the dorm, studying. Some buddies had a-an extra concert ticket. I never really liked Supertramp, but I went anyway, and… she jumped into the window of my car. She was running from this big dude. He had a gun, and she was screaming, “Don’t rape me again!” And I had to loan her my shirt, ‘cause…she was naked. And that was it. My pilot light was out and Monica was the gas company.</li>
<li>She taught me how to live. She changed everything. First time I ever did a line of coke… was with Monica. Smiling, laughing. </li>
<li>She was strong. And you’re strong. And she was brave, and you’re brave. I know you didn’t think much of her, but… she loved you. And you wouldn’t be who you are, and I wouldn’t be who I am, if she hadn’t come into our lives. So, hate her if you want… but she’s in you, and that’s a good thing.</li>
<li>And I miss you, Monnie. And it’s hard as hell. I love you.</li>
</ul>
</br>

<p>(Frank makes sarcasm of other rich fathers)</p>
<ul>
<li>I mean, we know most of these kids know nothing about hard labor. </li>
<li>Yeah. Neither do their fathers.</li>
<li>(Frank): It’s what’s wrong with our country, now. We fathers are off typing out emails or executing sell orders for hedge funds while we hire immigrants to do our manual labor for us. We don’t teach our sons how to work with their hands. we’re too busy to allow ourselves to get dirty, to show our boys how to earn an honest buck off the sweat of their brow. When’s the last time one of us mowed our own lawn? Or changed the oil in the Buick? Or dug a ditch? We are a generation of lost masculinity. And we gotta start getting it back. No matter if you’re straight or gay. And some of you look pretty gay. No matter if you stick it in the front or you stick it in the rear. For the love of our sons, we’ve got to stick it in there like a man.</li>
</ul>
</br>

<p>(Frank gets laid off and accuses the government for the unexployeement)</p>
<ul>
<li>I played by the rules. I gave my life, my blood, sweat, and tears to that job. Paid my taxes… Colored inside the lines. Didn’t roll through the stop sign. And where did it get me? Up the ass, that’s where. Right up the ole poop shoot. I was moving up in this world.<br> And now? I’m a 50-something adult white male with a couple of years of college and managerial experience, and the only thing available to me is minimum wage! The system is fucked! Give me a shot of Jamie. And leave the bottle.<br> The America we knew has ditched the party and turned the lights out, boys and girls. And left us white guys in the dark to fight each other over the few crumbs left behind by our masters. </li>
</ul>
<p>很多线没必要，carl的结婚，Lip和机车女的感情，Fiona的房子租出去，很离谱。Frank的找到工作，变成 圣人，</p>
